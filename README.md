### Description

The dataset used in this project is a cleaned version of an original data on Kaggle. The [dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/July/5b57919a_data-set-options/data-set-options.pdf) contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb).
In this project we'll brainstorm on what questions could be answered using the dataset, use pandas and NumPy to answer those questions, and create a report sharing the answers.

Steps to complete the project include:
- Data wrangling
- Exploratoty Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conlusions

### Tools used to complete the project

- Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

### Conclusion

Important findings are:
- The first research question dealing with the trend of movie genres seems to show that the 'Drama' genre has been increasengly associated with most of movies throughout. Though the 'Comedy' genre rose in 1980s, 'Drama' genre seem to dominate thereafter.
- It looks like 'Drama' genre of movies is associated with both most of movies with high popularity and those with low popularity. This can be justified by the fact that 'Drama' genre is associated with most of movies throughout.
